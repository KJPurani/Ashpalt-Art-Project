# Unit 1 - Asphalt Art

## Introduction

Cities use asphalt art to improve public safety, inspire their residents and visitors, and brighten communities. Your goal is to create asphalt art to revitalize The Neighborhood and bring the community together with the help of the Painter.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, algorithms, the problem solving process, and decomposition strategies to create asphalt art:
- **Create a new subclass** – Create at least one new subclass of the PainterPlus class that is used for a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Plan an algorithm** – Use the problem solving process and decomposition strategies to plan an algorithm that incorporates a combination of sequencing, selection, and/or iteration.
- **Write a method** – Write at least one method in a PainterPlus subclass that contributes to a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments.

## Notes: Neighborhood & Painter Class

This project was created on Code.org's JavaLab platform using the built in Neightborhood GUI output. To test and edit this project you must build in Code.org's JavaLab with the Neighborhood GUI enabled. For reference to the Painter class documentation, [you can read more here.](https://studio.code.org/docs/ide/javalab/classes/Painter)

## Reflection

1. Describe your project.

This project is about creating a vibrant heart design that gets painted onto a grid, with custom classes that build upon the basic painter's abilities. The MuralPainter class handles painting the background, while the HeartPainter class is responsible for crafting the detailed heart, using a variety of shapes and colors. The painting process itself follows a structured sequence of moves, loops, and conditions to bring the artwork to life on a virtual grid. The code is organized into multiple classes, each with its own specific job—like turning, moving, and painting—which helps illustrate key object-oriented concepts such as inheritance in a clear and effective way.


2. What are two things about your project that you are proud of?

   Object-Oriented Design: I’m particularly proud of the way the project leverages object-oriented design. The structure is clean, with separate classes handling different aspects of the painting process, such as MuralPainter for the background and HeartPainter for the heart design. Inheritance and method overriding are used effectively, which makes the code reusable.
   
   Algorithm Implementation: I’m also proud of the algorithm used to paint the heart. It incorporates loops, conditionals, and logical sequences to draw a complex shape on the grid. So, the way all the components work to make a perfect red-heart is also something that I'm happy about.

3. Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.

   If I had the chance to improve the project, I would focus on adding more complex shapes or dynamic patterns to make the design even more visually appealing. This would allow for greater creativity in how the art is generated, resulting in a more engaging final product. Additionally, trying the design on a larger 32x32 grid would provide more space for detail, making the artwork stand out even more and giving it a more polished and expansive look.
